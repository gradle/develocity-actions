## maven/build-scan-save
A Composite action to save an unpublished Maven Build Scan速.

The action uploads the Build Scan速 (if present) as a workflow artifact with name `maven-build-scan-data`.

The main use case is to reference this composite action in an existing Github workflow called to validate PR. 
Such workflows are running in an untrusted context and therefore do not have access to repository secrets.
Build Scans速 issued in such context are not published but can be saved with this action in order to be published by a subsequent workflow running in a trusted context.

**Dependencies**:

- [actions/upload-artifact](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-a-build-artifact)

**Event Trigger**:

This composite action can be called from any workflow but the main use case is to save unpublished Build Scans速 issued from workflows triggered on `pull_request` event

**Action inputs**:

N/A

**Usage**:

```yaml
name: Check Pull Request

on: 
  pull_request:

jobs:
  check:
    name: Check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'
